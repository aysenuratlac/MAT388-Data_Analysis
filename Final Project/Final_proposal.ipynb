    "\n",
    "In contemporary society, mental health has come into the spotlight with increasing recognition of its importance in individual well-being and social dynamics. An individual's early environment can play a crucial role in shaping mental health outcomes. Understanding the complex interaction between early environmental factors and psychological health may be useful in interpreting the origins of individuals' psychological problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary object of this project is to develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to discern the impact ofearly environmental factors on psychological well-being, as measured by the DASS. Through rigorous data exploration, feature selection, and model development methodologies grounded in statistical and machine learning frameworks, this research seeks to uncover nuanced associations between early environmental contexts and mental health outcomes.\n",

    "**Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various factors that determine the psychological state. These may be past traumas, but also environmental factors or lifestyle. With this research, we intend to find patterns of psychological state in individuals who are grown in similar environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this research, we aim to find answers to the following questions : \n",
    "- Could the psychological states of individuals who have grown up in different regions, such as cities or villages, be influenced by those regions? \n",
    "- Is there a significant difference in the psychological impact on individuals who have grown up in urban areas?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach can be described step-by-step as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preprocessing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some preprocessing steps that should be interpreted before constructing the model:\n",
    "First of all, we need to handle missing values by imputation or removal.\n",
    "Then, as the number of features are too high,we can do feature selection, by identifying and selecting the most relevant features using techniques like chi-squared test, mutual information, or feature importance scores.\n",
    "After that, we can check whether the data is imbalanced. If it does, we can address class imbalance using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or cost-sensitive learning.\n",
    "Additionaly, other preprocessing steps can be interpreted(i.e. identifying outliers, eliminate data by validity check test parts(VCL6-9-12))\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Selection:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will do detailed research about models that best fits the data, and decide which methods to use. Here are some models below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logistic Regression: A linear model used for binary or multi-class classification. It calculates the probability of a sample belonging to each class based on weighted combinations of input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision Trees: A hierarchical structure of nodes that splits data based on feature conditions, leading to class predictions at the leaf nodes. It's intuitive and can handle both numerical and categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and aggregates their predictions to improve accuracy and generalization. It reduces overfitting and provides feature importance scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): An ensemble technique that builds decision trees sequentially, each one correcting the errors of the previous one. It combines weak learners into a strong learner and provides feature importance scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Support Vector Machines (SVM): A model that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes in a high-dimensional space. It's effective for both linear and non-linear classification tasks and can handle large feature spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple algorithm that classifies a data point based on the majority class of its nearest neighbors in the feature space. It's instance-based and does not require explicit training, making it easy to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Visualization and Evaluation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In data analysis, visualization is essential due to how it converts detailed information into understandable insights. It makes data interpretation easier by using graphs, charts, and other illustrations to quickly identify patterns. Evaluation is another key component in constructing a model. It shows the performance of the model. In particular, we might use Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve and Precision-Recall Curve, other scores like F1 or accuracy, statistical significance tests, Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) or Class Separation Plot(e.g., using PCA or t-SNE).\n",
